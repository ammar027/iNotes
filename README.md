# iNotes - Cloud-based Note Taking App

iNotes is a simple, secure, and cloud-based note-taking app where users can create, update, and delete their notes. It provides a responsive interface with light/dark theme support, user authentication, and notes stored securely in the cloud.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Login and Signup functionality.
- **JWT Authentication:** Secure access to resources using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Notes Management:** Add, update, delete, and view notes.
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-friendly UI with Bootstrap.
- **Theme Support:** Switch between light, dark, and system-based themes.
- **RESTful API:** Backend built with Express.js and MongoDB.
  
## Tech Stack

### Frontend:
- **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router DOM:** For routing between pages.
- **Axios:** For making HTTP requests.
- **FontAwesome:** For icons and visual elements.
- **Bootstrap:** For responsive layout and styling.
  
### Backend:
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment for building the backend.
- **Express.js**: A lightweight web framework for handling routes and requests.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: Cloud database for storing users and notes.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: For secure authentication.

### Deployment:
- **Frontend**: Vercel.
- **Backend**: Render (or other deployment platform supporting Node.js).

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ammar027/inotes.git
   cd inotes
   ```

2. **Setup Backend:**

   - Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` folder.
   - Add the following environment variables:

     ```env
     MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
     JWT_SECRET="your_jwt_secret_key"
     ```

   - Install backend dependencies and start the server:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     npm start
     ```

3. **Setup Frontend:**

   - Go to the root directory of the project and install frontend dependencies:

     ```bash
     cd ../
     npm install
     ```

   - Start the React frontend development server:

     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

4. **Run Backend and Frontend Together:**

   To run both the backend and frontend together, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm run both
   ```

   This will run the backend on `http://localhost:5000` and the frontend on `http://localhost:3000`.
